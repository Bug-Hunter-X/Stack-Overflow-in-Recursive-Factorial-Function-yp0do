# Stack Overflow in Recursive Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: stack overflow. The `foo` function calculates the factorial using recursion.  For small inputs, this works fine, but for larger inputs, the function will exceed the maximum recursion depth, causing a stack overflow.

The solution demonstrates how to avoid stack overflow by using iterative approach.
